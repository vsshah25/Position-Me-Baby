#Local Positioning System 

Hola there ! :smiley:

We are a team of undergraduates from Electrical Engineering Dept , IIT Bombay. 

We are trying to build an object localizing system which can return location of an object with an accuracy in range of millimeters. 

All the required documentation is maintained in [references](https://github.com/pranav1001/Position-Me-Baby/tree/master/references)

If you are interested and want to contribute to the project then have a look at [issues](https://github.com/pranav1001/Position-Me-Baby/issues).
