#WIFI  

The router becomes an informal access point for the Internet, creating an invisible "cloud" of wireless connectivity all around it which is known as a hotspot. Any device under the scope of hotspot can connect to this hotspot and form a LAN. So basically, WIFI is wireless form of LAN. More technically, WIFI is known as IEEE 802.11 .

**Note** : The hotspot is essentially a collection of radio waves. The range of frequencies is between 2.4GHz - 5GHz. The frequency depends on the amount of data being sent.

The wifi receivers are just decoders and encoders which are capable of encoding and decoding data from electromagnetic(
radio) to electrical signals(digital).    

**More on frequencies of WIFI** : 
There are two types of Wi-Fi signal, based on the frequencies they use:

- 2.4GHz - A lower frequency, this is the more common Wi-Fi technology in use today. Many devices use it, so the signals can become more crowded and interfere with each other. It can pass through walls and windows fairly well.
- 5GHz - This higher frequency technology is used by fewer devices, and can sometimes achieve higher speeds because the frequencies are less crowded. It cannot pass through walls and windows as well as the 2.4GHz band signals, so the range of 5GHz technology is often shorter.

A routerâ€™s transmit power can be measured with two scales -- milliwatts (mW) or dBm:

A dBm is a relative measurement using logarithms. One milliwatt is 0 dBm. 10 milliwatts is 10 dBm; 100 milliwatts is 20 dBm, and so on. This is the scale that many network designers use to calculate if longer wireless links will work.
